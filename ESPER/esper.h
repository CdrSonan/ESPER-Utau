/*
struct holding all settings used by ESPER as a whole.
These settings should stay the same when combining multiple samples,
as they are used to determine the size of several internal arrays.

members:
sampleRate: the sample rate of the audio samples being processed in Hz.
tickRate: the number of processing windows per second of audio. Should be as close to sampleRate/batchSize as possible.
batchSize: the number of samples per processing window. Numbers with low prime factors improve performance.
tripleBatchSize: HAS to be exactly 3 times batchSize. The lowest frequency the engine can properly process is given by sampleRate/tripleBatchSize.
halfTripleBatchSize: HAS to be exactly tripleBatchSize/2.
filterBSMult: additional multiplier for the window size used during DIO pitch marker calculation.
DIOBias: legacy bias parameter for DIO pitch marker calculation. No effect in the current version.
DIOBias2: current DIO bias parameter DIO pitch marker calculation. Higher values favor marker candidates near the expected pitch more.
DIOTolerance: the maximum allowed deviation from the expected pitch for a marker candidate to be considered.
DIOLastWinTolerance: same as DIO tolerance, for the last window of a sample.
filterTEEMult: legacy multiplier used during true envelope estimation. No effect in the current version.
filterHRSSMult: legacy multiplier used during voiced-unvoiced separation. No effect in the current version.
nHarmonics: the number of voiced harmonics to be extracted from a sample.
halfHarmonics: HAS to be exactly nHarmonics/2 + 1.
frameSize: HAS to be exactly nHarmonics + halfTripleBatchSize + 3.
ampContThreshold: the threshold for the amplitude continuity check used during voiced-unvoiced separation. No effect in the current version, but reinclusion planned for future versions.
spectralRolloff1: number of the frequency bin at which to begin substituting the true envelope for a running mean spectrum. Used when combining "low" and "high" spectra.
spectralRolloff2: number of the frequency bin at which to begin fully replacing the true envelope with a running mean spectrum.
breCompPremul: the pre-multiplier applied to the compensation term used with positive breathiness values. Higher values increase the volume of unvoiced sounds when using positive breathiness.

/*
struct holding all sample-specific information and settings required by ESPER for a single audio sample.

members:
length: the length of the audio sample in samples.
batches: the length of the audio sample in batches. Should be floor(length/batchSize).
pitchLength: the length of the pitchDeltas array of the sample. Should be roughly equal to batches.
pitch: the pitch of the sample as a wavelength in samples. Should be the average of the pitchDeltas array.
isVoiced: whether the sample is voiced or unvoiced. 1 for voiced, 0 for unvoiced.
isPlosive: whether the sample is a plosive sound. 1 for plosive, 0 for non-plosive. Only used in Nova-Vox, no effect in any ESPER functions.
useVariance: whether to apply an additional postprocessing step to dampen spectrum and harmonic outliers. 1 if yes, 0 if no.
expectedPitch: the expected pitch of the sample in Hz.
searchRange: the range around the expected pitch in which to search for pitch markers. The range is determined as [expectedPitch*searchRange, expectedPitch/searchRange].
voicedThrh: the threshold for the voiced-unvoiced separation. Higher values classify more of the sample as unvoiced.
specWidth: filter width used for smoothing the high sections of the spectrum.
specDepth: how often to apply the true envelope and running mean filters to the spectrum.
tempWidth: filter width used for temporal smoothing between spectra.
tempDepth: how often to apply temporal smoothing between spectra.
